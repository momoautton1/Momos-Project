    <h1>The Interest Page</h1>
    <body>
        <p id ="InterestPage"> As I hear the stories of marketers
        of brands big and small, it’s quite clear that the preferred 
        method of targeting with Facebook ads remains interests. Even
        those with big budgets are putting their trust in Facebook to
        find those people most likely to convert based on related
        activity on the platform.When it comes to targeting my ideal audience with Facebook ads,I’ve always seen interest targeting as the last resort. When given
        the option, I’d strongly prefer reaching someone who is already
        connected to me (visits my website, is on my email list or likes 
        my Facebook page) to someone who might be a fit based on Facebook’s
        interest matching.One of the primary reasons for this is certainty. I have a level
        of certainty that when targeting someone connected to me that the
        content I show them will be accepted or embraced. But when targeting interests, I have a very low level of certainty that the people I’m reaching will act.
        The low level of certainty is due to the often vague nature of interests and how they are assembled. Why might someone have the “Digital Marketing” interest, for example? According to Facebook, it’s because they think digital marketing may be relevant to them based on what they do on Facebook, such as pages liked and ads clicked.
        But that’s a pretty vague explanation. And depending on the nature of a page or an ad, someone may like a page or click on an ad for any number of reasons — not necessarily because they have an interest in the category of content that is supposedly associated with it.
        I’ve had my doubts about interest targeting, but this was mostly
        based on theory and advertising results. Interestingly enough,
        Facebook provides very clear evidence for the potential pitfalls
        of interest targeting.</p>
