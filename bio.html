        <p id="biopage">Rodney Erickson is a content marketing prof
        essional at HubSpot, an inbound marketing and sales platform

        for a tech software startup. He graduated with honors from
        Columbia University with a dual degree in Business
        Administration and Creative Writing.If you're a marketer, you've likely heard of Ann Handley. Her list of credentials is lengthy, and if she really wanted to, she could go on and on and on about her accomplishments.
        But when people list out all their accomplishments in their bios, they risk sounding a little egotistical. Sure, you might impress a handful of people with all those laurels, but many people who read your bio will end up feeling either intimidated or annoyed. Think about it: Is that how you want the majority of your readers to feel when they read your bio? 
        To minimize the egoism that comes with talking about yourself, think about how you can list out your accomplishments without sounding like you're bragging. Ann does this really well, choosing a tone in her bio that's more approachable.
        It starts with the excerpt in the footer of her personal website. Give it a quick read, paying close attention to the opening and closing lines:</p>
