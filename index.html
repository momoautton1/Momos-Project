        <p id="flowers">A flower is the reproductive part of a plant that produces seeds. 
        Plants that produce flowers and fruit are called angiosperms. 
        There are more than 300,000 species of angiosperms, and their 
        flowers and fruits vary significantly. Flowers and fruits are
        among the most useful features for identifying plant species. 
        To most humans, flowers are seen as objects to decorate homes, 
        gardens, bodies, and more. However, flowers have a much more 
        important purpose than decorating. Flowers are the part of plants 
        that make seeds which in turn make new plants. In order to make 
        a seed, pollen from one flower has to combine with the eggs from 
        another flower; this is called pollination. Flowers are highly adapted 
        to attract their specific pollinators such as bees, flies, moths, 
        hummingbirds, and bats just to name a few. This is why flowers are brightly 
        colored and highly scented making them the beautiful creations that they are. 
        The facts about flowers are that without them, we would not have food,
        medicines, dyes, textiles, and other necessities of daily living. 
        There are so many interesting facts about flowers!</p>
